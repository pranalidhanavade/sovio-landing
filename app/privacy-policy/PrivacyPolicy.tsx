          Responsible for the processing of data on Sovio Platform (Verifiable

          2. Information on the Processing of Personal Data
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          Sovio Platform and Sovio Wallet are designed to prioritize user
          privacy. As a basic principle, no data is processed by AYANWORKS when
          the platform and app are used. All data is securely stored only on the
          user&apos;s end device, and AYANWORKS does not have access to this
          data.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          However, the platform and app are associated with a digital mailbox
          service (&quot;Mediation Agent&quot;) operated by AYANWORKS. The
          installation ID of the user is saved and processed for the purpose of
          the mailbox service. This allows incoming messages to be properly
          assigned to the respective user. The incoming messages are encrypted
          and sent to the mailbox service, which then forwards them to the
          user&apos;s platform and app. The recipient of the message receives a
          dedicated code from the mailbox service, which is linked to the
          installation ID.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          The Responsible Entity cannot identify individual users or access the
          content of the messages since they are encrypted and decrypted only on
          the user&apos;s end device. Once the messages have been properly sent
          to the platform and app, the mailbox service deletes them. The
          messages are held on the mailbox service until they can be delivered
          if the user&apos;s platform and app aren&apos;t accessible.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          To enhance the user experience and improve platform & app
          functionality, automated crash reports may be generated in the event
          of errors or application crashes. These reports may include
          information such as the cause of the crash, error reports, and
          additional data like the date and time of the crash, device model
          number, installed operating system version, language settings, and the
          user&apos;s country.

        >
          3. Legal Basis of the Processing
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          The processing of the installation ID is based on contractual purposes
          (Article 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR).
          The installation ID is automatically provided by AYANWORKS for the
          functioning of the mailbox service. Without processing the
          installation ID, AYANWORKS cannot assign or deliver incoming messages
          to individual users. The processing is necessary to fulfil the purpose
          of the contract, which involves the exchange of identity information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          Error analysis and other analyses are carried out in the legitimate
          interests of AYANWORKS (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). These analyses aim to
          ensure platform and app functionality and improvement. No automated
          decision-making is involved in these processes.
        </p>

          4. Recipients and Categories of Recipients
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          In general, data transfer to third parties (other than AYANWORKS) does
          not occur and is not planned. However, data transfer may occur in
          specific cases when legally obligated or with user consent. Such cases
          may include:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          - Public authorities and institutions (e.g., tax authorities,
          prosecution authorities, family courts, land registry offices) if
          legally or officially required for any purposes that is the interest
          of justice and so called upon by the appropriate legal authorities
          using the due course of procedure laid down by current provisions of
          law.

          6. Storage Duration
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          AYANWORKS processes and stores personal data as long as it is required
          to fulfil contractual obligations and protect our rights. The
          Installation ID associated with your personal data is also deleted
          when you close or uninstall the platform and app, respectively, from
          your device.

          7. Information about data subjects&apos; rights
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          As an affected person, the User has the following rights regarding how
          their personal data is processed:
        </p>
        <p>Right of access (Article 15 GDPR)</p>
        <p>Right to rectification (Article 16 GDPR)</p>
        <p>Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) (Article 17 GDPR)</p>
        <p>Right to restriction of processing (Article 18 GDPR)</p>
        <p>Right to data portability (Article 20 GDPR)</p>
        <p>Right to object (Article 21 GDPR)</p>
        <p>Right to withdraw consent (Article 7 Para. 3 GDPR)</p>
        <p>
          Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Article 77
          GDPR)
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          The User may reach out to us using the details listed in No. 1 to
          exercise these rights.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          7.1 Right of access (Article 15 GDPR) The Right of Access means that
          the User has the right to request confirmation from the Responsible
          Entity as to whether their personal data is being processed. If the
          processing is taking place, the User also has the right to obtain
          information about their personal data and the details listed in
          Article 15 Para. 1 of the GDPR.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          7.2 Right to rectification (Article 16 GDPR) The Right to
          Rectification means that the User has the right to request the
          correction of inaccurate personal data concerning them without undue
          delay. They also have the right to have incomplete personal data
          completed.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          7.3 Right to erasure (&quot;right to be forgotten&quot;) (Article 17
          GDPR) The Right to Erasure means that the User fundamentally has the
          right to request the deletion of their personal data without undue
          delay. The Responsible Entity is obligated to delete the personal data
          promptly if one of the reasons listed in Article 17 Para. 1 of the
          GDPR applies. For example, this can be the case if the personal data
          is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or
          processed (Art. 17 Para. 1 specified in a) GDPR).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          If the Responsible Entity has made the personal data public and is
          required to erase it, they are also obligated to take reasonable
          measures, considering available technology and implementation costs,
          to inform other data processing responsible entities that are
          processing the personal data about the User&apos;s request for
          erasure. This includes deleting any links to, copies of, or
          replications of the personal data.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          However, the Right to Erasure (&quot;right to be forgotten&quot;) does
          not apply in certain circumstances, as stated in Article 17 Para. 3 of
          the GDPR. For example, the right may not apply if the processing of
          personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or
          for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          7.4 Right to restriction of processing (Article 18 GDPR) The Right to
          Restriction of Processing means that the User has the right to request
          the restriction of processing their personal data under certain
          conditions listed in Article 18 Para. 1 of the GDPR. For instance, if
          the User disputes the accuracy of their personal data, they can
          request the restriction of processing while the Responsible Entity
          verifies the accuracy of the data.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          7.5 Right to data portability (Article 20 GDPR) The Right to Data
          Portability grants the User the right to receive their personal data,
          which they have provided to the Responsible Entity, in a structured,
          commonly used, and machine-readable format. The User also has the
          right to transmit this data to another responsible entity without
          hindrance, provided that the processing is based on consent or a
          contract and is carried out by automated means.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          Additionally, when exercising the right to data portability, the User
          has the right to have their personal data transmitted directly from
          the Responsible Entity to another responsible entity if technically
          feasible.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          7.6 Right to object (Article 21 GDPR) As soon as possible after the
          initial contact, we let the User know about their right to object. The
          Right to Object applies in the following cases:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          7.6.1 Right to object on grounds relating to the data subject&apos;s
          specific circumstances The User has the right to object at any time to
          the processing of their personal data based on their individual
          circumstances or for reasons of public interest. Profiling based on
          these laws is likewise subject to this right. Unless the Responsible
          Entity can show compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that
          outweigh the User&apos;s interests, rights, and freedoms, or if the
          processing is required for the establishment, exercise, or defence of
          legal claims, the Responsible Entity will stop processing personal
          data if the User objects due to their unique situation.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          7.6.2 Right to object to direct marketing If the User&apos;s personal
          data is processed for direct marketing purposes, they have the right
          to object to the processing of their personal data for such marketing.
          This right also applies to profiling related to direct marketing. If
          the User objects to the processing of their personal data for direct
          marketing purposes, the Responsible Entity will cease processing their
          personal data for those purposes.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          7.7 Right to withdraw consent If the processing of personal data is
          based on the User&apos;s consent, they have the right to withdraw
          their consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect
          the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its
          withdrawal. Before providing consent, the User must be made aware of
          their right to do so.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
          7.8 Right to complain to a supervisory authority The User has the
          right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if they
          believe that the processing of their personal data infringes the
          provisions of the GDPR. The relevant supervisory authority for the
          Responsible Entity is the data protection supervisory officer of the
          Government of India.
